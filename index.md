## Favorite CPSC 120L labs

* Lab 1, Part-1

    Lab 1, part 1 is easily one of my favorite codes because of how simple it is. It's a single line that tells you to print out "Hello" and then my name. It was my first ever code that I wrote and I remember not understanding any of it. Looking back now, I realize the progress i've made and how easy the code was. I look back on it for fun because it reminds me just how much we all managed to learn in such a small time and it makes me very happy knowing I understand topics I never knew before.

* Lab 4, Part-2

    Lab 4, part 2 is one of my favorite labs as it introduced the idea of using code for games. Although it was very simple, the lab was making a secret number, and having to guess what that secret number was. Instead of just printing out code and expecting an outcome, we would input out own value and have to play around with our code to understand it. I really enjoyed this lab because it felt very interactive and overall was very fun when I showed my friends how it worked and how we eventually made it.

* Lab 7, Part-2

    Lab 7, part 2 is again, one of my favorite codes because it introduced a game I was very familiar with and understood how it worked. Coding Blackjack was not as hard as I already knew the values to the cards and the rules of the game. It was very fun as you would eventually see the whole project come to life and seeing the game work at the end was the most satisfying thing ever. This lab felt very easy and although it was a little long and tedious, I wasn't stressing because I knew the end result would be worth it and fun to play around with after.
